"###  About
-----------------

I'm Luke Briggs: a Computer Science student from the UK studying at Newcastle University.

#### About Site
This is a site where I will share what I think might be helpful to other people in similar
places in life. Most of the stuff here will be related to side projects, my academic work, and will
be a reference to which I will point to on occasion.

The full story of how this site was created can be found [here](https://www.google.com) but the short
story is as follows: It is written by my own fair hand (discounting the numerous, non-remunerated hours that
more intelligent people spent on the libraries upon which I depend). The back end runs on [flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/),
the front end is entirely basic html and css, none of that flexbox/grid/bootstrap shenanigans here. All my blog posts (including this about page)
are written in markdown and then rendered as html server side using [Mistune](https://mistune.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
